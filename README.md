# Scripts For BUPT （北邮校内可使用脚本）
> Projects in this directory are some little scripts for convenience, customized for BUPT students (ok, just me)...

## Introductions
* **get-your-gpa（输入URP密钥计算GPA）**: Help you get your gpa easily, no need to login into URP, even no CAPTCHA (check code) needed. The script will help list all your scores and give you a summarized GPA. See [here](/scripts-for-bupt/get-your-gpa).
* **login-GW（网关登陆）**: Help you login into the GW (10.3.8.211) automatically. See [here](/scripts-for-bupt/login-bupt-gw).
* **draw-CAPTCHA（绘制验证码）**: Help you generate a CAPTCHA picture, with your assigned `width` (`height` is `[width/2]`), and assigned `count` of numbers/letters in the CAPTCHA. See [here](/scripts-for-bupt/draw-CAPTCHA).
